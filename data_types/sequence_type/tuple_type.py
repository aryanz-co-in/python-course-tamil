# list, tuple, range  Sequence Types

# Tuple
# Tuples can be considered as read-only list.
# Difference between List and Tuple is just the enclosing brackets.

fruits = ("Apple", "Banana", "Watermelon")
# Tuples cannot change the value in between, Only List can do it.
# fruits[0] = "Grapes"
print(fruits)
